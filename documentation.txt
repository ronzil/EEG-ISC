Initilize

download eeglab. open somewhere and add MATLAB path to it.

(* bug in parsebvmrk.m so I made my own version in <analysis-dir> directory. Local dir takes precedence so scripts will work fine.)
- i dont like this... perhaps make all my files it's own plugin based on BVs. (must not be installed together)




Load one file:
   EEG = pop_loadbv('C:\bigdata\debates\rep\', 'GOPDebate_Ivonne_0001.vhdr');
