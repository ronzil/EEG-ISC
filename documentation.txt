eeg analysis
------------


Initilize
----------
download eeglab. open somewhere and add MATLAB path to it.
download BrainVsion plugin and add it to eeglab/plugins

cd <analysis-dir>
(* bug in parsebvmrk.m so I made my own version in <analysis-dir> directory. Local dir takes precedence so scripts will work fine.)
- i dont like this... perhaps make all my files it's own plugin based on BVs. (must not be installed together)
